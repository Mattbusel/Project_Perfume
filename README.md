Fragrance Chatbot with Email Functionality
This project is a Python script that allows you to interact with a fragrance expert AI and get recommendations on various fragrances. It also provides the option to email the responses to yourself or others.

Features
Chatbot Interaction:

Ask questions about fragrances, such as popular choices, recommendations for specific occasions, or personalized suggestions based on your preferences.
Receive informative and helpful responses from the AI fragrance expert.
Email Functionality:

Option to send the chatbot's responses via email.
Specify the recipient's email address and a subject for the email.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries using pip:
Bash
pip install requests smtplib
Use code with caution.

API Key:
You need an API key from a service like RapidAPI to access the fragrance expert AI.
Replace the placeholder "abf60d6769msh5066b8a2895cb64p1e58bajsn326511ef8429" in the code with your actual API key.
Email Credentials:
If you want to use the email functionality, you need to set up your email credentials:
Gmail:
Use your Gmail address and an app password generated specifically for this script.
You might need to enable "Less secure app access" in your Gmail settings if you encounter authentication issues.
Other Email Providers:
Adjust the SMTP server and port settings in the send_email function accordingly.
How to Run
Set Up Environment Variables (Optional):

If you prefer to store your email credentials securely, set the following environment variables:
EMAIL_ADDRESS: Your email address.
EMAIL_PASSWORD: Your email password or app password.
Run the Script:

Execute the script from your terminal:
Bash
python your_script_name.py
Use code with caution.

Interact with the Chatbot:

The script will first provide some example questions and responses.
Then, it will prompt you to enter your own fragrance-related questions.
Type exit to quit the interactive session.
Email Responses (Optional):

After each response, you'll be asked if you want to email it.
If you choose 'yes', enter the recipient's email address.
The email will be sent with the subject "Fragrance Recommendation."
Important Notes
API Key: Ensure you have a valid API key and replace the placeholder in the code.
Email Security: If you're using Gmail, consider using an app password for enhanced security.
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling, but you might want to add more robust error handling for production use.
Customization: Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific needs, such as changing the email subject or adding more features.
